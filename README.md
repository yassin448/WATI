# WATI Assistant

WATI Assistant (Wise Ai for Textual Interaction) is an AI-powered assistant with a variety of features, including conversational abilities, arithmetic and equation solving, weather updates, YouTube music playback, and more. This assistant uses a combination of pre-trained models, semantic similarity, and fallback mechanisms to provide accurate and helpful responses.

## Features

- **Conversational AI:** Uses a pre-trained language model for generating responses.
- **Arithmetic and Equation Solving:** Solves arithmetic expressions and algebraic equations.
- **Weather Updates:** Fetches weather information for specified locations.
- **YouTube Music Playback:** Plays, pauses, and stops music from YouTube.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes the sentiment of user queries and provides emotionally responsive answers.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Allows users to provide feedback and update answers in the dataset.
- **Simulated Typing Effect:** Displays responses with a simulated typing effect for a more human-like interaction.
- **User History Navigation:** Navigate through user input history with the up arrow key.
- **Dynamic Chat Interface:** Clear chat history, exit the application, and send queries through a user-friendly interface.
