# WATI Assistant

WATI Assistant (Wise Ai for Textual Interaction) is an AI-powered assistant with a variety of features, including conversational abilities, arithmetic and equation solving, weather updates, YouTube music playback, and more. This assistant uses a combination of pre-trained models, semantic similarity, and fallback mechanisms to provide accurate and helpful responses.

## Features

- **Arithmetic and Equation Solving:** Solves arithmetic expressions and algebraic equations.
- **Weather Updates:** Fetches weather information for specified locations.
- **YouTube Music Playback:** Plays, pauses, and stops music from YouTube.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes the sentiment of user queries and provides emotionally responsive answers.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Allows users to provide feedback and update answers in the dataset.
- **Simulated Typing Effect:** Displays responses with a simulated typing effect for a more human-like interaction.
- **User History Navigation:** Navigate through user input history with the up arrow key.
- **Dynamic Chat Interface:** Clear chat history, exit the application, and send queries through a user-friendly interface.

### Available Commands:

- **Arithmetic and Equations:** Ask math-related questions or provide equations to solve.
  - Example: `Solve 2 + 2`, `Solve x + 2 = 5`
- **Weather Updates:** Ask for weather information.
  - Example: `What is the weather in New York?`
- **YouTube Music Playback:** Play, pause, resume, or stop music from YouTube.
  - Example: `Play music Despacito`, `Stop music`

### Navigation

Use the up arrow key to navigate through your input history.

### arguments 
1. --use-core (uses the finetuned version of wati)
2. --use-groq (uses fallbackai)


### Notes
1.this version is still in beta and you may experience incorrect or totally broken answer so please try to use the arguments correctly and follow the guide in this readme for it to work properly 
2.to use groq or (the fallbackai) you need to obtain and api key by signing up on this website:https://console.groq.com/playground and after signing in you need to go to the api key tab and generate a new one and open the Aidata file and put it in get api key
3.you will find the ðŸ¥‡ finetuned Wati version on the release tab which you need to install and add to the same directory of the ai for the --use-core to work
